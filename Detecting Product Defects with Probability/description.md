## Overview 

Estimate the probability of defect products within the Poisson distribution (7) 

## Project Goals
 - Calculating the probability of observing the rate parameter on a given day
 - Calculating the probability of higher and lower defects
 - Using a sample distribution of 365 to calculate an average number of defects per day, observing the maximum value or more
 - Using a sample distribution of 365 to calculate how many defects in a given day would put us in the 90th percentile of the distribution
 - Simulate a dataset, determine  what proportion of the simulated dataset is greater than or equal to the percentile

## Technologies Used

- Code: Python, Scipy.Stats, Numpy 
- Math: Poisson Distribution, probability mass function, cumulative distribution function
