## Overview
Using the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify) to calculate sample distribution of Spotify song tempos and evaluate probabitity of having high-beat dance songs.
## Project Goals

 - Calculating the sampling distribution of a mean, minimum, variance 
 - Visualise the above using graphs
 - Calculating population mean and population standard deviation, standard error 
 - Calculating the probability that the sample mean of 30 selected songs has specific tempo

## Technologies Used
Code: Python, Scipy.Stats, Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, Pandas
Math: Sampling Distribution, Central Limit Theorem, unbiased estimators
