## Overview
[Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindaramsriram/energy-consumption-dataset-linear-regression/data) provided information of various energy consumption details. The project was aimed at understanding the relationship between number of appliances used and consumed energy by modeling linear regression prediction model 

## Project Goals
- Visualize the relationship between energy consumption and number of appliances used
- Build and fit a model to predict energy consumption based on the number of used appliances. Interpreting the intercept and slope values
- Verify assumptions about linear regression by plotting fitted values and residuals (residuals look approximately normally distributed, homoscedasticity assumption was met)

## Technologies Used
Code: Python, statsmodels.api, Pandas, Matplotlib
Math: Linear regression
